# What?

* This is an exploration in building the 'perfect' guitar - for me.
* There is no luthery school around here so I've decided to take a perfectly good Fender Jaguar guitar and try to bend it to fit.
  * 24" Short scale
  * But very heavy
  * P-90 - replaced with GFS Humbucker

# Why

* To learn - by screwing up
* To explore - by trying new things
* For fun and relaxation


# Inspiration

* I like the modern guitars - Mostly [DBZs](http://dbzguitars.com)
  * They play great and are beautiful

* [Koz][koz]
  * There's lots to like about Koz guitars
    * Curves
    * [Digital lutherie](http://www.kozmguitars.com/digital_lutherie.html)
    * [CNC use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu8_Aeki6iY)
    * Curves

* [Stranberg][stran]
  * Headless guitars scream 'modern' to me
  * I __like__ the look without the head
  * Having the tuners on the body makes more sense to me

# Headless

### My next, next guitar will be headless - using a lot from this exercise

* Bridge
  * [Hipshot](http://store.hipshotproducts.com/cart.php?m=product_detail&p=390)
  * [ABM](http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-ABM-3800-C-7080-C-6-String-Headless-System-For-Guitar-CHROME-/330929401368?pt=Guitar_Accessories&hash=item4d0cedee18)
  * [Stranberg](http://guitarworks.thestrandbergs.com/products/purchase-page/)
* Shape - probably a lot like this one

### I _don't_ like 

* Plastic
* Multiple pickups
* Heavy

### Thoughts

* Fine tuners on a fixed bridge
* Traditional tuners that use allen wrenches only - making them more compact
* Jack on the back
