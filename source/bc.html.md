# BC Rich <small> aka  "off with your head"</small>

## Cool

* Speed loader - the head is a prop
* Make it headless
* Body is mahogony - nice wood actually
* Smaller size ~7/8
* Lock the bridge so it is not floating
* Less agressive - fewer sharp edges
* Use the head as hanger for git

## Cons ...
